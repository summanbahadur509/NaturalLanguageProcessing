Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Mr. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. In Pakistan, he is recognized as Quaid-i-Azam!, which means "Great Leader" and Baba-i-Qaum which means "Father of the Nation". Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for British Indian Muslims. Naïve people do not know what he has done for the country
